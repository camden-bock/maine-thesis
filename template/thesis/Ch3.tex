\begin{quote}
	The idea that disease was caused by entry into the body of imperceptible particles is of ancient date. It was expressed by Roman encyclopaedist Marcus Terentius Varro as early as 100 BCE, by Girolamo Fracastoro in 1546, by Athanasius Kircher and Pierre Borel about a century later, and by Francesco Redi, who in 1684 wrote his \textit{Osservazioni intorno agli animali viventi che si trovano negli animali viventi} (Observations on Everything must have a parent, he wrote; only life produces life.) The germ theory of disease would not be accepted widely for another 1,900 years.
