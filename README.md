# maine-thesis
A LaTeX class file for the typesetting of a Masters or Doctorate Thesis at the University of Maine (Orono, ME).

## TODO
The goal of this fork is to update to the current graduate school specifications and make available in CTAN.

## Installation

To install this class file simply copy or link `maine-thesis.cls` to your texmf tree.  On Unix based systems one of the following commands should work:

`cp maine-thesis.cls $(kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME)`

`ln maine-thesis.cls $(kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME)`

On Windows machines the equivalent commands are:

``for /f "usebackq tokens=*" %a in (`kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME`) do copy maine-thesis.cls %a``

``for /f "usebackq tokens=*" %a in (`kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME`) do mklink %a maine-thesis.cls``

The advantage to linking over copying is that once you've set this up, you need only use `git fetch` to make updates, but you do have to keep your copy of the repository.

## Thesis Guidelines

The latest version of the [official thesis guidelines](https://umaine.edu/graduate/students/progress/thesis/) is now available online.

## Repository inventory:

Besides the class file itself, this repository contains the following additional resources:

### Documentation

The files in the Documentation folder serve both as the documentation for this class file and as an example of its use.

## Contributing

If you find a bug in the class file or something that it doesn't format correctly, please contact me either by posting an issue here on [GitHub](https://github.com/rpspringuel/maine-thesis/issues) or by [emailing me](mailto:rpspringuel@gmail.com).  If emailing me please include `maine-thesis` in your subject line in order to avoid spam filters.

Also, when reporting a bug or something that needs to be changed a MWE that demonstrates the current unacceptable behavior and a picture or complete description of the desired result is really useful.
